Linked List
-----------
- Linear Data Structure, each element(node) is a separate object.
- Dynamic Data Structure, number of nodes are not fixed, can grow or shrink based on demand.

Advantages:
> Can be Extended or reduced to fit the data set.
> easy to maintain new insertions and deletions.
> Efficient Memory Utilization (i.e. no need to pre-allocate memory)
> Faster access time, can be expanded in constant time without memory overhead.
> stack, queue can be easily implemented

Disadvantages:
> It doesnot allow direct access to the indivitual elements, you have to start at the head and follow
  the references until you get to that item.
> Linked list uses more memory compare with an array.

Types of Linked Lists:
- Singly Linked List
- Doubly Linked List
